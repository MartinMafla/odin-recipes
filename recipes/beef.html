    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Corned beef is a beef brisket (a cut of meat from the breast or lower chest) that has been cured in a salt solution. "Corning" results in intensely flavorful, super tender meat. In this recipe, the corned beef brisket is seared in a hot skillet and then braised all day with garlic and onions for a melt-in-your-mouth texture and perfect flavor.

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            1 (5 pound) flat-cut corned beef brisket
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon browning sauce (such as Kitchen BouquetÂ®), or as desired
        </li>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon vegetable oil

        <li>
            1 onion, sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            6 cloves garlic, sliced
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons water

        </li>
        <li>
            Discard any flavoring packet from corned beef. Brush brisket with browning sauce on both sides.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and brown brisket on both sides in the hot oil, 5 to 8 minutes per side.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place brisket on a rack set in a roasting pan. Scatter onion and garlic slices over brisket and add water to roasting pan. Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil.
